#### Back to basics

This is a fair attempt to recap on the important aspects of algorithms and data structures with a focus on problem solving. I happen to perform dismally at this and this is an attempt
ameliorate that situation for my own benefit (interviews, personal projects etc).

This repo will hold my learnigs as I do this. I have done this before and promise myself to kee at it this time round and not falter.

I have taken this chance to write python3 as well.

##### Running Tests

I use `pyqtest` module as the test runner.

Clone this repo and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
Ensure `PYTHONPATH` environment variable is set: run `export PYTHONPATH=./` from root folder.
Run `pyqtest -q`.

##### Help

Any feedback is welcome. Kindly open a PR and I will have a look at it.

##### ToDo

In the future, add an accompanying blog with articles.
